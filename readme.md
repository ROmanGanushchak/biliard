## Introduction

Billiard is a simple simulation of billiard balls colliding on a table. The simulation is built with Python and Pygame and includes a custom collision system to handle the physics of the balls interacting with each other and the table boundaries.

## Features

- âš¡ Realistic ball movement and collision physics
- ðŸ”§ Custom collision system for handling ball interactions
- ðŸŽ® Graphical interface built with Pygame

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Python and Pygame installed. You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
git clone https://github.com/your-username/billiard.git
cd billiard
python main.py
